%ISRL - Intrinsic Subspace Representation Learning
%
% Syntax: [U,V] = ISRL(X,A,gt,lambda)
%
% Input:
% X: multi-view data, X is defined as cell(1,v), where v is the number of views
%    the format of X{i} is n_dimension*n_samples
% A: anchor of the multi-view data, A is also defined as cell(1,V)
% r: exponent of weights
% lambda: hyper-parameter used in the proposed ISRL
% ridx: index of the weights for different views
%
% Output:
% U: cell(1,v), matrices for diversity information, U{i} is n_anchor_number*n_anchor_number
% V: n_anchor_number*n_number, it is the intrinsic subspace representation used for clustering
% labels: clustering results
